# Ouroboros

## Synopsis

The PCs set out to intercept Ammit and the Nine Bows fleet.

## Scenes

### Scene 1

Ship time.

As the *Ghost Shark* accelerates, the PCs meet once more before going into Stasis.

### Scene 2

Ingtrigue

The PCs come out of stasis aas the *Ghost Shark* completes its wide, arcing, braking manueuver to bring it paralell to Ammit's fleet and matching its velocity. The deceleration burn takes days.

A massive tanker/ice-hauler with empty rigging decelerates from the fleet. Ammit contacts ther *Ghost Shark*: we've sacrificed that vessel as a sign of good faith. Drop back and board it to negotiate your surrender. Let the fleet pull ahead of you and out of weapons range as a sign of your good faith, Pisceans, if you grasp the term.

The ship is worn down, flickering, most power diverted to the engines by hard-wired changes at this point of the voyage. Crewed by wary Nine Bows people, who look nearly exactly like the Pisceans represented in the communal history passed down by Burn's people in their account of the occuptation of their system. The crew is unarmed.

The PCs are guide to the bridge. A zombie stasis pod floats on its vertical access with four surgical arms attached, a long forked tail of energy weapons and firearms welded to jointed metal tendons, a ghostly green light illuminating the faceplate and behind it a skull with gold circuits cascading from its eyes.

"I am Ammit. At the request of the Nine Bows, I have come to adjudicate you and measure your worthiness to surrender."

Next to ammit, a uniformed office - the captain or someone in charge of representing the Nine Bows. Speaks a language with some of the sounds and cadences of modern Piscean. "Startalker. Agreement. Life."

Ammit again: "Convince me that you have learned from my dread tutleage the error of your ways and that you are ready to welcome your betrayed siblings as your betters and acccept Ammit as your judge and warden."

Startalker again: "Agreement. Life. Reconciliation. Neighbors."

The PCs must convince Ammit that the Pisceans have abandoned their plans to murder the Nine Bows and they must convince Startalker of their willingness to live with the Nine Bows. The PCs may adjudicate this agreement and make it binding. They may also try to escape and attack the fleet, leaving the tanker to chase after them.

Ammit wants the PCs to admit their guilt and accept its sentencing. Startalker wants the PCs to pledge that the Pisceans will negotiate a peaceful settlement agreement with the Nine Bows.

Agendas might include:

- Establish peaceful intent.
- Repent.
- Accept Ammit.
- Assure Startalker that they can negotiate a settlement agreement.

### Scene 3

Crew

During their acceleration, the PCs get a call from one of the surviving pre-cog buoys. 

They can try a hard deceleration to save the pre-cog, adding time to their trip back, or ignore it.

This is an evasive manuevers scene in which they have to decelerate, avoid colliding with the buoys, get close enough to bring it aboard, and accelerate again assoon as possible or miss the window to make it home before Ammit and the Nine Bows fleet.

If the PCs recue the precog succesffully, they take aboard Voidgill, an ancient, weakened Piscean with amazing farseeing powers. They can ask him all kinds of questions once he's cleaned up and cared for aboard the *Ghost Shark*.

16 maneuvers at chop 3.

### Scene 4

Ship time

The PCs make it back to the inner system, 20 years later.

They're intercepted by the *Undertow*, a destroyer guarding the gate to Gemini. The Gemini refuses to let them pass and threatens to fire on them - clearly this is a Stranger incursion!

Another destroyer decelerates into near space. It's the *Godly Whale*. A familiar voice on the comms: "*Undertow*, this is *Godly Whale* actual. Fuck off. We're retrieving our asset, Purge your logs of the last 4 hours. *Ghost Shark*, it's Lifeboat. Welcome aboard."

The PCs join Lifeboat aboard the *Godly Whale* in her ready room. Her morphology is female now; she is still slight, freckled, and always fidgeting with restless agitation. She is also an admiral now.

Lifeboat asks for the PCs report, cautiously approves theirn decisions, and then briefs them on the last 20 years:

- A faction of Bright One cultists infiltrated Piscean civilian government and then seemed to lose all interest in politics just as it seized control of the system, letting the Precog Command rise again.
- This sudden change in power dymanics happened right around the time of a cataclysmic collapse of the Gemini wormhole that seems to have sealed away the Stranger threat.
- The Houses and the Consortium have been at war, with an opportunistic new faction called the Guild picking up the pieces, like Antimony Station.

Lifeboat:

"I knew you would make it back, but I still can't believe it. It's amazing. Impossible. But that's why I need your help. One more mission. Then you can have anything - you can hgve it all. Want to go home? Done. A ship? Done? A command? Done. Anything. But I made a mistake I can't fix. I put an adjudicator on a ship called the Barghest. I knew its crew would somehow ened the Stranger threat once and for all. They all wentto Gemini; fought the Strangers; closed the wormhole. They sacrificed themselves to save Zodiac Space. None of them made it back. None of them weresupposed to make it back. But one of them did. The adjudicator. My protege. He went mad and snapped the thread I wrapped around him. He came back. He'sbeen assassinating civilian governors, military officers, precog commandos ever since. He found evidence of a conspiracy between our civilian government, the Bright Ones, and the Strangers. He's been killing for 20 years. He has an accomplice. A former trainee. They're so closely entangled now, we can't track one without seeing the other. But you've been gone. You don't know them. They have no way of seeing you. I know it seemed like I sent you out there to die. I sent you out there to come back, forgotten, invisible, and impossible. I need your help to right my wrong and save this government from a madman's revenge. I need you to find the Adjudicator known as Deadeye and bring him to the fate he escaped in Gemini/."

## What happens next?

The PCs begin the hunt for Deadeye at the only place anyone really remembers him - Antimoney Station - where two pre-cog dropouts sit at a bar getting fat off mushroom whiskey as they tell stories about the good old days and the best precog CO ever.
