# Ouroboros

## Synopsis

The PCs must enlist the Ohka's aid to evade the pre-cogs' dragnet and punishment.

## Scenes

### Scene 1

Intrigue

"Burn, what are you here to do?"

Gestures of welcome becomes looks of uncertainty and concern. Burn's friend Fury goes on: "The elders had called a circle to welcome you home, but now I think you need to explain why you've come before we know if you're welcome or not."

Fury leads the PCs back to the Ohka circle, a improvised, nomadic camp of low shelters with double plastic roofs for moisture collections that squat beneath the tops of the dry, sharp, salt-encrusted outcroppings needling the Ohka reserve. Low, wide photovoltaic generators interpose the tarp shelters; terminals, charging stations, small arms all connect to them via wires. The Ohka sit in a circle of threshed grasses in the middle, observable by air, but not easily seen from across the horizon.

The PCs stumble into the circle, though their Ohka escort step gracefully into it and sit. Fury speaks: "Elders. Burn has returned. Wearing the governor's badge. Bringing Pisceans. I ask you to decide what to do."

Six tribes are represented here, all of their elders most concerned with their tribe's survival, and then Ohka survival. Six elders; a few dozen Ohka with small arms and melee weapons, like Burn's whip.

Burn recognizes her elder by their vestments, but not the elder themself. It's someone new. Angon.

An elder speaks: "We have heard the story you told the system, Burn, but we have also heard the Pisceans' story about you. What would you say to us? What keeps us from giving you back to your new tribe? You have their scent all upon you. Why shouldn't we exchange you for something to extend the life of the tribes?" Tapping their chest.

The PCs should establish their agendas for what they want from the Ohka.

### Scene 2

Evasion

A scout rushes into the circle. "The disappearers come. Drop ships."

The elder: "If you come with us, you are of the tribe, Burn, and we recognize them as your family, if not Okha. You incur the debt we incur. There can be no turning back. Or go to your ship, Burn, and flee, and lead them somewhere else."

The scout: "There are many. We must hide."

The PCs must either go with the Ohka into the saltland canyon warrens or get back to the *Ghost Shark*.

This is a 12-point scene at alarm 3.

### Scene 3

Combat

The PCs must either guard the Elders' escape or fight through Black Badges to board the *Ghost Shark*.

There are 2 Piscean heavies by the ramp and 2 snipers on parked drop ship roofs. Snipers add 6 to 1. Heavies add 4 to 2.

After the PCs defeat their enemies, a rush, like wind down the hill, hits them. Four more drop ships inbound. They start landing and dropping their ramps, but then suddenly abort and pull up and disperse in a juttering rush. A diplomatic shuttle swoops in their wake and lands.

The ramp drops.

It's Gethu. Someone wrapped in a medskin and I/O lid, the kind people wear for long-term life support needs. A scruffy looking Leonin human. A tall, bald Piscean, pale blue, almost translucent, in white robes.

"Heroes of Pisces, would you join me aboard the *Icebreaker*? You should know better than to be found  "

The shuttle takes them into orbit and on to dock with the *Icebreaker*. They see another dreadnaught in orbit. It's the *Undertow*.

### Scene 4

Ship time.

Gethu gives the PCs time to freshen up in opulane quarters aboard his regular military flagship.

The PCs can metagame and calbirate and rekindle relationships.

### Scene 5

Intrigue

Gethu wants to embarass the pre-cogs and get them to admit making mistakes in their treatment of the Ohka and Nine Bows and to take responsibility and accept the consequences for building forbidden colony ships. (Zherga will give up Lighthouse.) Gethu also wants a newly brokered peace extending rights to the Ohka and all galactic refugees in the Piscean system with their assimilation into the system handled by a public-private partnership between the Piscean government and the Bright Ones, a pan-systemic charity dedicated to expanded consciousness and understanding by contemplating celestial superbings who offer a vision of hope and peace as an alternative to the pre-cog command's constant pregnostications of doom.

The PCs should negotiate what they want in return to testifying publicly to Gethu and the high council on Chlorine as to the pre-cog command's illegal orders regarding the Nine Bows and illegal pursuit of the PCs through protected Ohka land as the PCs sought asylum with the Ohka in order to contact Gethu and bnring their important story to the system in safety.

"Very good, my children. And now tell me, what will you do after we cripple your command?"

## What happens next?

PCs testify against the pre-cog high command and get their rewards from Gethu before deciding what to do for the rest of the campaign. Ammit is out there. Lighthouse's personal effects will make their way to Lifeboat.
