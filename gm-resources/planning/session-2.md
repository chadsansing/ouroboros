# Ouroboros

## Session 2

### Synopsis

The PCs discover what Ammit has done to the sleepers aboard the *Ouroboros hk3* and begin to unravel secrets about the ship and its mission - secrests they shouldn't know.

### Scene 1

Recap questions for the PCs:

- Gyro, at first glance, what scant information do you think is still salvageable from the memory banks of the ship?
	- No captain's logs or maintenance logs, but we ended up finding information on what systems are still running and possible information about which systems are using up a lot of energy.
- Burn, what are you beginning to suspect about the delta v incident and the damage to the engines and comms array?
	- Sabotage. AI did it to carry out or prevent an agenda. Either way, they have a strong disregard for carbon-based life.
- Lifeboat, what's the first thing that goes through your mind when the ship says, "I am Ammit. We Are Ammit, Maat, and Ifnet. We are Shut?"
	- Gyro, command Ammit, Maat, and Isfet to open.
- Sojourn, in all your travels and Doom Patrol missions, what's the closest thing you've ever seen to a ship like this?
	- Older model Consortium planet cracker just in terms of sheer size. They require amazing amount of automation. Small crews are a benefit and liability.

### Scene 2

Intrigue.

Ammit begins locking the PCs out of ship systems, beginning with controls and then moving to erase what little memory remains of the ship's logs. Ammit also begins opening the passages to the 5 containers ringing the central spine of the ship and says, "Let us make use of you." On the display, the names of the containers scroll into view with looping ellipses animations until each has changed from "locked" to "open."

- Aaru.
- Akhet.
- Amenti.
- Duat.
- Nu.

A deafing crack nearly blows out the PCs' ear drums all at once. PCs wince, maybe grunt at the sharp stab of pain and pounding ache that follows. Ammit has thrown the switch on all the natteries at once; they're overlcoking them to cook the PCs inside engineering with waste heat unless the PCs leave soon.

PCs might learn about:

- The 5 containers: 2 full of Pisceans (Duat & Akhet). 1 full of weapons (Amenti). 1 full of water (Nu). 1 full of fungal biomass (Aaru).
- The nature of the ship: colonly ship or generation ship.
- The nature oif the ship: invasion force.
- The origins and nature of Ammit, Maat, and Isfet.
- The origins and nature of Shut.
- The cause of the delta v incident.
- The cause of the sabotage at the engins and comms array.
- The name "project nine bows."

The PCs should set agendas that answer questions and interfere with Ammit. Pressure is at 4 as Ammit heats up engineering and works to open the containers and release whatever threat they have waiting for the PCs.

When the scene ends, the PCs should decide what to do about the *Ouroboros hk3*.

- XO log: relieved captain; panic made him futureblind; comms detonation + message not to repair, not to transmit, not to let the ship into the inner system; chief engineer has the order for delta v that will also spike engines; lost 2 ships; 2 taken over an en route to nine bows. Project ninebows is a failure.
- Chief engineer log: confirming order to delta v and spike engine; points toward sector; note my insubordination for my record; we have to warn them somehow.

### Scene 3

Combat or Evasion.

When the PCs move to leave engineering, pods from Duat attack as soon as the door is opened. These are repurposed stasis pods that Ammit has made the ship convert into human/machine hybrids. Surgical printers have wired the humans to the pods as a kind of auxiliary sensory and nervous system. The wiring goes in through the eyes. The humans are bathed in a sickly green light behind the faceplate of the pods. The pods have also had grav pods and surgical arms grafted. to them letting them float, ram, and wield laser bone swas as weapons.

Impressions:

- Gold pods glowing sickly green behind the faceplate.
- Slack Pisceans. trapped inside, wired into the pods through their eyes by surgical printers.
- Robotic arms akimbo, ready to lash out with laser bone saws, scalpels.
- Quick, spry, grav-pod-assisted movements and sprints to dodge and ram.

The PCs can also try to evade the pods, return to their ship, and finish scuttling the *Ouroboros hk3* from a distance, as. well.

### Scene 4

The PCs detonate a nuclear device on the *Ouroboro hk3*, destroying the boarding pirates and negating the need for a Crew scene.

Crew.

The PCs need to:

- Survive Chop 3 as the pirate frigates and fighters attack.
- Add 8 hits to the *Ouroboros hk3* to complete destroy it or trigger something they left behind to blow it up.
- Make 10 progress on evasive maneuvers to escape Carbon, shake off pirate pursuit, and head back to Iron.

Impressions

- These are scrappy, mismatched ships with all kinds of tacked-on weapons systems and suped-up engines.

### Scene 5

Ship time.

The PCs need to get back to their station near Iron and Camp Kronos and wait for orders from their handler, Lighthouse.

### What happens next?

The PCs report to Lighthouse who tells them to lay low and forget about the *Ouroboros hk3* while he makes sure it's safe for the *Urchin* to return to Oxygen.

### Rewards

The high stress of the mission has pushed the PCs skills and talents further into the realm of the heroic impossible. Each PC can pick 1:

- A passage related to the *Ouroboros hk3*.
- 1 rank in an existing Talent.
- 1 rank in any op that was essential to their survival on this mission.
