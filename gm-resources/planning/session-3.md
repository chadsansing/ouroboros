# Ouroboros

## Session 3

### Synopsis

The PCs get word from Lighthouse that to unravel the *Ouroboros* mystery, they'll have to travel to Oxygen.

### Scene 1

Ship time.

Reset fatigue and Phoenix Protocol.

Stoke relationships as you wait for Lighthouse to contact you.

### Scene 2

Intrigue.

Lighthouse contacts the PCs. High command has ordered them to purge their logs and report to Chlorine for reassignment.

Lighthouse doesn't like it. He says, "Gravity," which is your key to switch to an encrypted channel you set up with him when he became your handler. Once you respond with, "Wins," he'll know it's safe to speak freely.

Lighthouse shares that when he made his report, he felt his futures constrict with every order he got to bury this mission and drown you all within military bureaucracy. He wants you to disregard the high command while he stalls. Instead, he wants you to poke around something called Project Nine Bows. He's called in some favors and has a few names - well, Nine Bows and a callsign. An old pensioner on Chlorine. Fiendhunter. Find him. Find out what Project Nine Bows is and what Fiendhunter had to do with it. 

"Get to Chlorine, just don't report to high command. I'll stall for you."

Once the PCs reach Fiendhunter, he will say, "I knew you were coming. But it's already too late. Ask your questions quickly. Before the Black Badges kill me."

Fiendhunter is:

- A pensioner in an old, worn-down, but not scrapped part of the station. Old Piscean pensioners leaning on railings. Gosspining about the future. Younger working class Pisceans making deliveries, going to work in coveralls.
- Tiers of habitats, railings, ladders, stairs. Architecture from an older age of station efficiency, maybe rusty and archaic now rather than crammed in.
- Bent by age, but always pushing against it to sit and stand straight.
- Alone in the dark. Salt lamps giving off just a few lumens. Blinds drawn against the hum and glare of station life.
- Always drinking water.
- Blue, mottled with pourple. Wrinkled. Skin like looking at the top of the ocean.
- Wearing a precog jumpsuit with his callsign.
- Carrying a slag-caster in a hip holster.
- An old, faded vac suit hanging on a peg by the door.
- Surrounded by pictures of him and his family - parents, siblings, their families. Not his own family.

The PCs might discover that:

- Project Nine Bows was an invasion force disguised as a relief missions.
- A single distress call reach Pisces from the Nine Bows people. Their star was heating up. They needed relief and evacuation within decades if they were to survive.
- Precogs had seen the Nine Bows people displace the Pisceans in the future and ordered their destruction.
- The built the *Ouroboros* fleet in secret. Five illegal colony ships to fool and destroy the Nine Bows.
- We built a long-range chain of observation buoys and staffed them with entangled precogs to report on the progress of the fleet. The fleet dropped more as it traveled. Batteries and sacs of nutrients embalming our bes adjudicators. I was one of them. Close to the system. Relieved aftera decacde.
- Our controller, Wallfacer, he's on Copper, refusing to leave his post until he can warn us of Ammit's return with the Nine Bows. 
- A few of us are left alive in buoys, though the precog command stopped our changing of the guard ten years ago. 
- Something happened. We lost 2 ships. 2 went on to Nine Bows. You found the 1 that returned here to warn us what happened.
- Ammit built itself from the dreams of the sleeping commandos. In assessing their mental health, it learned to read their dreams and discern their intent. It concluded that we, the Pisceans, had to be destroyed to save all other life. All it's ever known of the Pisceans are our commandos' dreams of war. It built its other intelligences to test strategies against us and decided to press on to Nine Bows, turning our troops against as and going to Nine Bows to rescue the people and help them invade us.
- Most precogs can't read the threads of machines.
- We were the Nine Bows.

Pressure 4. PCs decide on 3-4 questions. They have 4 rounds before the black badges arrive.

### Scene 3

Combat.

Anti-material rounds and phase bullets riddle the room and tear Fiendhunter apart. The PCs have to fight their way out of the apartment and back into the station to escape. A Black Badge kill team is set up with 1 fireteam in the corridor outside the apartment and 2 snipers on buildings across the way.

Snipers do 6 to 1. Hallway commandos to 4 to 1 or 3 to 2.

### Scene 4

Evasion.

Once the PCs mnake it out of the apartment, they have to call the *Urchin* to them or reach their hangar. Let them decide what to do and set up waypoints. The big idea is to evade or otherwise neutralize the Black Badge kill squads dropping all over the block from gunships like the *Urchin*. Tactical movement. Supression fire. Snipers. Getting pinned down.

Alarm 4.

### Scene 5

Crew.

The PCs have to shake off or defeat the two remaining drop ships (frigates) hounding them off of Chlorine.

### What happens next?

The PCs have to report to Lighthouse and then search for the Carbon. shipyards or find Wallfacer on Copper and ask about the current status of the *Ouroboros* fleet.

### Rewards

The high stress of the mission has pushed the PCs skills and talents further into the realm of the heroic impossible. Each PC can pick 1:

- A passage related to the *Ouroboros hk3*.
- 1 rank in an existing Talent.
- 1 rank in any op that was essential to their survival on this mission.
