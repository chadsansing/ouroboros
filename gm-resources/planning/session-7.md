# Ouroboros

## Synopsis

The PCs must testify against Zharga in return for the rewards they negotiate with Gethu.

## Scenes

### Scene 1

Ship time.

Gethu gives the PCs time to freshen up in opulane quarters aboard his regular military flagship.

The PCs can metagame and calbirate and rekindle relationships.

### Scene 2

Intrigue.

Gethu and his advisors have a proposal to make: your hearts' desires in return for exposing the treasonous command of Admiral Zharga, their illegal comissioning of generation ships, and their failed genocide of our ancestors, which has led to th creation of an AI that threatens all life in the system.

Low-pressure: pressure 2. This should feel too easy, but awkward and creepy as Gethu's aids seem to communicate with one another through looks and throughs, not words.

### Scene 3

Intrigue.

The trial of Zharga.

The *Icebreaker* docks on Chlorine.

Gethu calls together the high council in its chamber. Zharga, Gethu, and Byorme, to hear evidence against Zharga and remove him from command and the council.

The PCs arrive to find Gethu and Byorme and their adviosors, minor atendants, and guards. Gethu says the proceeedings will begin once Zharga arrives. It's a tense moment.

Adjudicators lead in a uniformed admiral, insanely well-decorated, wearing a disruptor lid - Burn recognizes these. Inside their are bliding lights, deafening noises, cauterizing wires - everything you'd need to dull the senses and distract someone with pain and fear of loss. The most diseased and disassociated troops among the Piscean invasion and occupation forces sometimes used them on Ohka prisoners.

The Adjudicators lead the prisoner to a space in front of the high council's bench.

Then Zharga comes in from behind the bench and takes their seat.

"Let's end this mockery of temporal jurisprudence."

Gethu accuses Zharga of treason brought on by the hubris of their precognitive powers and command and demands their removal from the high council and the appointment of another civial councilor representing certain pan-systemic spiritual movements, a faction commited to peace and fuller engagement with the rest of Zodiac Space through philosophy and trade. Gethu calls Zharga an "invasive xenophobe" whose paranoia has made them futureblind. Specifically, Zharga stands accused of:

- Embezzling Piscean funds for covert military operations.
- Building illegal generation ships in secret.
- Launching those ships on a genodical mission.
- Allowing, through neglect, the AI aboard those ships to emerge and go rougue, killing thousands of Pisceans, and perhaps millions more in the near future.
- Abandoning the buouy precogs at their posts.
- Putting the entire future of the Piscean system at risk in 40 years' time timeo satisfy their murderous impulses.
- Keeping all of this secret from the high council and denying due process of adjudication that might have led to vastly different outcomes.

Byorme can't believe any of this: "Zharga has safeguarded our furture for generations, Gethu. I warn you - if you overreach!"

Gethu invites the PCs to read their statements. The agenda is to convince Byorme of Zharga's guilt. Pressure 4.

Byorme: "Well, Zharga?"

Zharga's defense is: "Because it went one way, it cannot go the other. I regret that I focused too intently on the issues of Ohka assimilation, the attack on Gemini, the threat of the Strangers, and growing influence of the Consortium. It made me too trusting and too willing to look away for too long. The crimes you list have indeed been committed, as has a nuclear attack on one of our returning generation ships. and they were all orchestrated by this Piscean, whom I am sad to say I once trusted but cannot anymore. They used loopholes in the Phoenix Protocal to escape notice again and again. Despite their guilt, I would ask for mercy. Few have died to many times doing what they thought was right and necessary for Pisces. They will testify to their culpability."

The adjudicators step forward and remove the disruptor lid. It's Lighthouse, who smiles ruefully at the PCs, and then darkly, before turning to the high council with a suddenyl blank expression: "What Admiral Zharga says, whatever he says, is true, and I accept blame and responsibility for all of it. My badge contains all the evidence you need."

Zharga looks directly at Gethu and adds: "Whatever the sentence is, it must be, but I would ask for - and accept lenience for - these poor unwitting dupes of the traitor's who have overcome such odds to stand here before us that I believe there may be purpuse to them yet." A hard stare at each. Gethu leans back deeply into this chair. Byrome leans forward, shocked.

Zharga: "A vote as to my guilt?"

Byorme: "Not guilty."

Zharga: "Not guilty.

Gethu: "Not guilty."

Zharga: "Adjudicators, take this traitor into custody and begin court martial proceedings against them at once."

### Scene 4

Evasion.

Gethu beckons the PCs to join them before the bench as the high council chamber clears of Byorme, Zharga, and their retinues.

As they approach they overhear the following:

To the person in the med suit and lid as they pick up a duffle and chem rig: "The *Barghest*. You'll recognize the captain; you've seen his kind before."

To the Leonin: "I will see you again on Antimony one day, my friend. Keep the way free."

To the pale Piscean: "I will join you on the *Icebreaker* shortly. Prepare communion for the bridge crew."

Gethu to th PCs: "Everything is as you asked it, if not as I wanted it. I would not stay on Chlorine another moment if I was you. From what I understand, Zharga would like to conscript you for one last mission, if you take my meaning."

"And here. A note for you the prisoner got to me."

From lighthouse: "There's a present waiting for you in my apartment."

Gethu motions to the door of the chamber. A few black badges are starting to file into the room. "Run, pre-cogs. I will shoo Zharga's dogs. Leave through the door behind the bench."

This kicks us into an evasion scene. PCs must make it off Chlorine, through Lighthouse's apartment or not. Alarm 4. 12-points.

### Scene 5

Ship time.

The PCs make it to Lighthouse's apartment. The *Urchin* is there, hard docked to the same hole in the wall it made last time.

The *Urchin* will only open up for Lifeboat. There's another note on the stick. "No nukes aboard this time. I promise. Best get going."

As you pop off the surface of Chlorine, each of you lost in your own reflection of what all this means, you don't notice the emergency beacon going off on the comms board until it's almost too late. It's the collision alarm and a broadcast - "Break off! Break off, dammit, you fucking Piscean bastards! Now now now!"

And Lifeboat gets Urchin out of the way in the nick of time to avoid colliding with the spine of a docking ice hauler.

Before the emergency channel is cut off: "You move like a goddamn space whale." And Gyro, a moment of loss and confusion as your drone lifts off, hovers nearby, and reaches out to someone or something else in a strange fellowship, and then returns to perch on you.

Moments later, as Gyro moves towards engineering, they call you all down to the galley. There are also 4 crates, each addressed to a different crew member. A stack of slimtabs on the table, as well. Manifests for the *Ouroboros* ships; HUMINT analysis from the buouys.

To Sojourn: "The curse of living." A dynamic virtual map of the outer system showing the positions of the buouys from decades past until a hundred years in the future. A hand-written journal cataloging the name, callsign, rank, and exploits of every pre-cog entombed in a buouy, each name accompanied by a rough sketch of the Psychopomp badge. The last page: "Sojourn, Fe패rnei tin Entoli패 Apo패 to Ka패os, Captain, Psychopomp. Unkillable. The one that brought them home."

To Burn: "The curse of freedom." Slimtab full of geological surveys of what you immediately recognize as the Ohka saltlands. Keyed and labeled with polymetallic nodule deposits (iron, manganese, copper, cobalt, and nickel), peridotite deposits (jewelry, but more importantly, CO2 scrubbers), and polymetallic sulfide deposits (copper, zinc, lead, iron, silver and gold). Attached is an audio-file memo with *Ouroboros* era pre-cog cant and Zharga's voice: "Plenty to do once we starve the Ohka out."

To Gyro: "The curse of knowing." A manifest of your home vessel with all but 5 names crossed out; the rest, including yours, are circled. A black box cleaved nearly in half down the center. 1 remaining name labeled with Antimony Station in Scorpio. 3 others labeled with Nihonium in Gemini.

To Lifeboat: "The curse of command." Instructions, "Deliver to bay 17-10, Antimony Station", a date ten years from now, and a hand-written letter:

"My dearest one. It is as if I see you all the time. As if we still talk. As if your love guides me. Wherever I look, I am nearly convinced you are here, but then I remember the fate I assigned you. You are always and only in the right place, my love. Aboard that ship, you will save us all. When you left, I thought it would break you and that I would have to stop you when you came back with all your pain and rage. But now I see how wrong I've been. I won't be here when you come back. I should never have planned to stop you. I should never have thought to deny you your pain and rage. Use it. Finish your work. Mop up Gethu's twisted conspiracy, dismantle Zharga's engine of inevitability before their very eyes. Follow the threads that connect us to all of his agents, and, after you kill them, tell Zharga the story of our love and sacrifice before you drive your blade through his cloudy eyes. I am no longer sure if I have succeeded in my mission or fulfilled my half of our obligation to Pisces. One day, it will be time to come home. Until then and after, I will be where you look. Kidemonas Ta Matia, Lighthouse, Admiral, Pre-cog Command."

And beneath it, a picture on a slimtab of a slightly younger Lighthouse and a much younger adjudicator in full-dress, embracing and smiling at the camera, Camp Kronos and a graduation celebration in the background.
