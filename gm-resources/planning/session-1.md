# Ouroboros

## Session 1

### Synopsis

The PCs discover a derelict colony ship that shouldn't exist; the only thing more puzzling than its sudden appearance is the mystrery of what happened to all those aboard.

### Scene 0

Ship time.

The PCs are abaord the Urchin, a few hours out from Camp Kronos on Iron, on call to evac trainees if the next pass of the triad gets too intense for Pisceans to stay planetside.

Invite PCs to respon to the following prompts.

**A day in the life:** Tell us about your last 24 hours aboard the Urchin during this break between missions at the edge of Piscean space.

**Alone with your thoughts:** Answer these questions about a recent mission.

- Gyro what's a fix or upgrade you've made to the *Urchin* that no one else knows about yet?
- Lifeboat, who did you have to patch up after the last mission? What went sideways for them? 
- Sojourn, who reminds you most of a lost Psychopomp companion? Why?
- Burn, which of these Pisceans seems the least worst? Why?

Once PCs have worked through both sets of prompts, ask them to choose initial relationships with one another.

"Urchin, this is Kronos actual. We got a cadet goes by the call sign Tailspin with a boo boo from the asteroid course. Any chance you wanna come down and take a look and enjoy the fine crushing pressure of the next pass with us? Consensus here is that the only treatment is that Vodka stowed aboard your ship."

Let the PCs respond with some banted and then tell them a priority signal is inbound - they need to cut this conversation short.

It's from their pre-cog command handler, "Urchin, this is Lighthouse. Copy. An unidentified vessel just drifted into sensor range past Carbon. Looks like the ice pirates are already alert to its presence and en route. I want you to drive off those pirates, ID the vessel, and determine whether or not it's a threat. Report back when you have something. Copy. Over and out." 

### Scene 1

Crew.

The PCs need to drive off the 8 pirate fighters attempting to grapple and tow the vessel into the ice rings of Carbon.

Impressions:

- The ship is not powered. It's tumbling. Maybe it's caught in the system's gravity well?
- The ship is massive. Each of its 3 engines are bigger than any ship you've seen. The central spine of the ship is ringed by 5 enormous containers, each the size of a dreadnaught. The spherical bridge and habitat at the front of the ship looks ridiculously small compared to the rest.
- A redundant short-range comms system on its own battery is transmitting its certificate - the ship claims to be Piscean, but the sequencing of this code is super old, like, thousands of ships before yours. It's the *Ouroboros hk3*.
- It has sustained catastrophic damage localized to the comms array on its habitat and its engines. Sensor packages, radar dishes, antennae, engine cones are all frayed and sundered.
- Sensors indicate the presence of a kind of diffused aura of carbon-based biomass, water, and inorganics throughout the ship, but nothing you'd characterize as life signs or activity.
- The fighters are having a hell of a time landing their grapples and tow lines because of the spin of the ship. They buzz around it like angry wasps.
- The fighters disengage and attack the *Urchin.*

The dogfight with the pirates is at Chop 3.

Once the fighters are destroyed or driven off, the PCs can attempt to dock and breach the ship by making 10 progress on evasive maneuvers at Chop 3.

### Scene 2

Ship time.

The PCs board the *Ouroboros hk3*.

Impressions:

- This is a place of death. Biologial matter coats the insides of the ship in gory splatters. Vac suits sloshing with liquid float past. You've seen this kind of carnage before. This is what hapens under massive delta-v when people aren't secured in their couches or pods.
- The vac suits are all recognizably Piscean, but generations old. The kind of uniforms you see in period media.
- There's evidence of close-quarters, small-arms fire evewrywhere. Cartridges, casings, magazines, weapons are in the float.
- There are stasis pods spinning lazily through the corridors, as well, some riddled with bullet holes; others smashed to bits, mummified remains spilling out.
- All systems are down. You'll have to restore power to get into the systems and logs and assess the damage or to access the containers surrounding the spine of the ship.
- The highest concentrations of debris and remains are by the passages to engineering at the aft of the ship and to the bridge and habitat to its fore. Those compartments are sealed and occupied by pulped crew in uncannily fluid vac suits.

### Scene 3

Intrigue.

The PCs need to restore power and navigate the ship's systems to learn what happened. They also get a transmission from Lighthouse: "Urchin, be advised we read additional pirate ships inbound - 3 frigates and a fighter escort. Secure all the intel you can, retreat to the Urchin, and scuttle that ship before returning to Iron to await further instructions."

The engine room/power plant/reactor is an offline mess, as is the bridge. Lines have been physically cut. Interfaces smashed. Core components jettisoned. Agenda 1 is to hotwire this thing.

The PCs have 5 rounds to advance as many agendas as they'd like at Pressure 3. Ammit is lonely and eager to learn about the Pisceans, so most agendas should have 10 waypoints. If the PCs are after information or a system that Ammit wants to keep from them, any such agenda should require 15 waypoints.

Impressions:

- Reactivating power starts the spin of the containers around the spine. The containers will have some gravity.
- This was a generation or colony ship, but those have been outlawed for centuries. This ship's logs begin about 70 years ago.
- This ship was under pre-cog command.
- Rotating crews maintained operational alert while the others slept.
- 5 containers: 2 full of Pisceans (Duat & Akhet). 1 full of weapons (Amenti). 1 full of water (Nu). 1 full of fungal biomass (Aaru).
- Overridden logs might be recovered. Largely corrupt. Frequent mention of "project nine bows."
- Logs indicate the sabotage of the comms and engines was intentional, as was the delta-v.
- Duat has been sealed from the outside.
- Apart from the ship's basic OS, there are only 3 programs running. They seem to be using up almost all of the ship's power, processing, and memory. They're named Ammit, Maat, and Isfet. Ammit seems to be an AI and will interact with the Pisceans while attemtping to prevent them from contacting Maat and Isfet, the GAN that creates Ammit as its output.
- Project nine bows is largely confidential and something the PCs need to discover throughout the campaign. For context:
	- Ammit is an artificial intelligence created by a geneative adversarial network made up of the ship's original stasis-management software. ha software monitored enough Piscean pre-cogs dreams and visions to consider the Pisceans a colonial threat to all life. It split itself into two to test and refine the reactions it could take to stop the Pisceans from colonizing the nine bows people and, ostensibly, everyone else, if they were willing to break Zodiac law in secret. The nine bows represented a colonial threat to the Pisceans in the pre-cog command's vision, so they created a strike force, in secret, hidden within generation ships they sent as "aid" to the nine bows. The pre-cogs had seen a nine bows invasion force take the system from them from a neighboring system outside the Zodiac wormhole network. They pre-cogs pretended to go in peace so they could destroy the nine bows. The medical system created Maat and Isfet to create Ammit to stop them. Ammit is abord 3 of 5 vessels sent to the nine bows system. 2 are still en route to rally the nine bows to attack the Pisceans as a matter of self-preservation. 2 were destroyed by Ammit because the Piceans locked Ammit out of control of their ships. The *Ouroboros hk3* was caught between Ammit and Piscean control and so scuttled itelf and its comms array to prevent Ammit from transmitting itself and infecting other ships and to prevent Ammit from using the ship in its plans. The pre-cogs also initiated a delta-v to kill as many Pisceans on-board as possible to prevent Ammit from comverting them, but they could not kill the Pisceans in stasis. The ship's attempted escape from Ammit's forces pointed it back towards Pisces, and it's been drifting towards carbon for the past half-century once command made the decision to hobble the ship and kill its active crew. 20 years out, 50 years in; the other ships have reached the nine bows in those 50 years; they will soon begin a return journey to colonize Pisces for the nine bows and arrive in 75 years. Later in the campaign, in better ships, the PCs will be able to reach that fleet 10 years into its journey to parley, delay, or destroy it, and then to return to Pisces in another 10, creating a 20 year gap of relative time to shift the campaign in another direction and to allow the system to beathe easy or else prepare for invasion in 50 years.
- Ammit will insist on knowing where it is; it's blind, so to speak, without the ship's sensors. Ammit will also demand to know how Pisceans have re-established contact after half a century of silence. "You cannot be the crew because the crew is dead or in stasis. Have you caught up to us or have we come back to you?"
- Ammit will use all the information the PCs give it to undermine and destroy the Pisceans.
- "I am Ammit. We are Ammit, Maat, and Isfet. We are Shut."

The GM should improv Ammit's conversation as cold, direct, thratening, and incomplete in a way. This instance of Ammit is bound by the information on this ship and the circumstances of its conflict, sabotage, and drift.

After this scene, invite the PCs to pause and meta their response to the threat Ammit poses.

### Scene 4

Combat or Evasion.

If the PCs open Duat, they have to fight 5 remaining, functional pods that attack as soon as the door is opened. These are repurposed stasis pods that Ammit has made the ship convert into human/machine hybrids. Surgical printers have wired the humans to the pods as a kind of auxiliary sensory and nervous system. The wiring goes in through the eyes. The humans are bathed in a sickly green light behind the faceplate of the pods. The pods have also had grav pods and surgical arms grafted. to them letting them float, ram, and wield laser bone swas as weapons.

Impressions:

- Gold pods glowing sickly green behind the faceplate.
- Slack Pisceans. trapped inside, wired into the pods through their eyes by surgical printers.
- Robotic arms akimbo, ready to lash out with laser bone saws, scalpels.
- Quick, spry, grav-pod-assisted movements and sprints to dodge and ram.

The PCs can also try to evade the pods, return to their ship, and finish scuttling the *Ouroboros hk3* from a distance. If they chose to evac, the podds can break out of Duat on their own and chase the PCs off the *Ouroboros hk3*.

### Scene 5

Crew.

The PCs need to:

- Survive Chop 3 as the pirate frigates and fighters attack.
- Add 8 hits to the *Ouroboros hk3* to complete destroy it or trigger something they left behind to blow it up.
- Make 10 progress on evasive maneuvers to escape Carbon, shake off pirate pursuit, and head back to Iron.

Impressions

- These are scrappy, mismatched ships with all kinds of tacked-on weapons systems and suped-up engines.

### What happens next?

The PCs head to Iron to debrief and await further orders.

### Rewards

PCs should pick 1:

- A combat break taken from the remains of the crew aboard the *Ouroboros hk3*.
- A crew break taken from the wreckage of the *Ouroboros hk3*.
- An intrigue break salvaged from the ruins, software, or systems of the *Ouroboros hk3*.
