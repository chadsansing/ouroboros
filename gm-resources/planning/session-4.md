# Ouroboros

## Session 4

### Synopsis

Lighthouse sends the PCs to Copper to find Wallfacer before offering them a deadly mission to confront Ammit 10 years in the future.

### Scene 1

Ship time in Lighthouse's safehouse. Lighthouse, diminutive, freckled, and fluid, skims the *Urchin* along the skin of Chlorine station, daring the Black Badges to open fire on vital and populated parts of the station. Then they swing the *Urchin* underneath Chlorine and into its shadows. After a few more minutes of dizzying turns to lose the Black Badges, they deploy the hardened airlock and breach their safehouse from outside the station.

"Take all the time you need to collect yourselves. But not that much. I've got to go see a friend about killing me and bringing me back to life. Handy thing about the phoenix protocol - it snaps the strings; they must be gathered again. It'll buy us time. Go to Copper. Find Wallfacer. Get an update on Ammit and then lay low in Carbon. I'll find you."

### Scene 2

Crew.

The PCs have to land on Copper and make it to Wallfacer's station while it's embroiled in a triple pass with Iron and Sodium. Its atmoshphere and crust are splintering and streaming into space, creating a tempest of turbulence and a planet-wide debris field they have cannot avoid.

### Scene 3

Intrigue.

Copper, Iron, and Sodium are tearing one another apart. The *Urchin* won't last. Wallfacer is preparing to descened to the deepest parts of Copper Station, to seal themselves in, and wait out the pass. PCs have 3 turns to make as much progress as possible at Pressure 4 before they'll be marooned here.

### Scene 4

Evasion.

Wallfacer sends the PCs to the ice fields of Carbon. Lighthouse is waiting with a signal that guides the PCs past a maze of accretion to a hidden shipyard.

"This is where they built the illegal generation ships. This is where they're building the new scoop ships with Stranger tech. You need to land on one of those ice balls, infiltrate the ship yard, and steal a scoop ship to stop Ammit. I'll cover you as best I can."

Alarm starts at 3 - the station is swarming with techs and Black Badge security. Fighters trawl the ice field. This scene is part planetary ring parkour and part breaking into a top secret base a la the Cold War thriller Fire Fox.

### Scene 5

Waiting for the PCs at the ramp to the scoop ship is Admiral Zharga, CO of the pre cog command. Zharga is flanked by a squad of Black Badges. Lighthouse is with them, kneeling, bound in grav shackles.

Zharga motions for the PCs to drop their arms.

Then he looks at Sojourn. "Welcome back to the corps."

Zharga tosses out 4 badges from beneath their cape. 3 are Psychopomp badges. 1 is an Adjudicator badge. It's clear that the PCs are expected to choose.

Once the PCs have chosen, Zharge unshackles Lighthouse, rips out their staff command badge, and replaces it with an Adjudicator badge and addresses Lightouse instead of the PCs. "That one" - pointing at the PCs' Adjudicator - "makes it back to report no matter the cost. The rest can die with this heretical project."

Lighthouse looks at the PCs, spreads their arms as if to apologize, and then sweeps them towards the ramp of the scoop ship as if in invitation. "Find Ammit. Determine its intent and strength. Delay it if possible. Report back. The *Ghost Shark* is yours. See you in 20."

## What happens next?

The PCs go into hibernation for nearly a decade before their confrontation with Ammit and the Nine Bows.
