# Ouroboros

## Synopsis

The PCs must decide what to do about their mission to Ammit aboard the hyrbid Piscean-Stranger ship the *Ghost Shark*.

## Scenes

### Scene 1

Ship time.

The PCs must resolve the urgent tensions spilling over from their confrontation in the Carbon shipyards. Then they have to decide whether or not to pursue Ammit.

### Scene 2

Evasion.

If the PCs double-back to Pisces, Lighthouse will move to intercept them.

"What are you doing, Lifeboat? Burn, seize control of that vessel. You can't come back. You have to leave the system. You are going to wreck everything. You've left me no choice. I'll brand you traitors and summon the fleet. Run. Don't stand and fight. Go after Ammit. Please."

Lighthouse sics the Piscean aramada on the PCs, whom he brands traitors. The *Icebreaker*, *Godly Whale*, and *Undertow* decelerate towards the *Ghost Shark's* position. It will take 16 evasive maneuvers at chop 4 to escape back into the system.

**Revision:** Weave through 3 dreadnaughts' sensor nets at Chop 2; critical failures raise the Chop by 1 up to 4. 3 rounds; approach to Oxygen and landing are Chop 4. Skip to Oxygen's surface. 16 maneuvers.

### Scene 3

Intrigue.

Once the PCs make it to a safe harbor, they have to convince its people to let them in; this could be some kind of faction on Antimony, the Bright Ones on Chlorine, the Okha on Oxygen, etc.

PCs should establish the agendas they have to overcome or push to be accepted and protected under acceptable terms.

### Scene 4

PCs' choice.

This should be the PCs first op against the pre-cog command. Let them pick a problem to solve and their approach to it.

**GM's proffer:** If the PCs choose to spread the message warning of the pre-cog command's planned genocide of the Nine Bows, this might be an evasion or intrigue scene to reach a rendezvous point with a mysterious ally (Gethu and Bright One clerics - one Piscean and one Gemnini orphan) somewhere out of sight. Maybe in some Okha ruins or aboard Antimony Station or aboard a Guild tradeship, like smuggler Kade Kincaid's frigate the *Moonbuoy*, or aboard the *Icebreaker* in transit inside a wormhole. Or maybe they go to Antimony, find Kade, and get shuttled to the *Icebreaker* in the neubla or in transit back to Pisces.

## What happens next?

The PCs advance their plans against the pre-cog command with Gethu working behind the scenes to gain the PCs' endorsement of a Bright-One-brokered peace.
